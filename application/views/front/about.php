          <span class="videotitle1">Education is the fundamental right of the children in our country. But whether quality education is available to everybody is a matter of debate. Students India is established with a vision to make quality education available to all the children irrespective of economic and social status. Students India journals reach you with the best educational material that ensure the comprehensive development of children. We entered into the world of publishing in 2015, by bringing out learning materials for the students of classes 5 to 10. The students, teachers and parent community wholeheartedly accepted this unique learning experience. In 2016 we started publishing educational journals for Plus Two and Plus One students. Along with this there came out the learning aids for CBSE class IX & X students. 2017 onwards we publish learning aids for pre-primary to class 4. All these are available in malayalam and english mediums. The team of expert academics together with the state-of-the-art facilities at the content development centre of Students India is behind the formation of these journals. We offer excellent service to the customers by combining efficient management and effective distribution system

          <span class="videotitle1"><br />We have instituted the best and most modern research and development facilities to achieve this objective. It is a great challenge to develop educational aids for the students belonging to various knowledge levels, ranging from the Pre-primary to the Plus Two level. Each and every student is different in many aspects. Loads of talents are hidden in them. Education should serve the purpose of arousing these latent talents in the students and making them ready to face the future life. Then only education becomes meaningful and worthy. It is this sublime thought that the Students India people have always in mind while preparing each and every educational product. Special care has been rendered to make each and every lesson comprehensive but simple so as to easily digestible to all students irrespective of their learning standards. A group of dedicated personnel including well-experienced academics in different subjects, writers, artists, designers and so on, take part in different phases of the formation of these journals. These things have been carried out effectively and efficiently with the help of the most modern technology and software assistance and internet facility. Thus the best and No. 1 educational journals are formed here. Students India now brings out 30 different educational journals ranging from pre-primary to higher secondary level.
